#THESE SCRIPTS TAKE DFT ISOTROPIC EXPANSION CURVES AND SMOOTHLY INTERPOLATE THE DATA TO ZERO AT THE CUTOFF 
#BY FITTING THE DFT DATA TO A ROSE EOS MODULATED BY A CUT OFF FUNCTION
	#THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN USING A SHORT CUTOFF Rc<5 ang BECAUSE DFT DATA
	#HAVING DATA AT LARGE r HELPS TO TRAIN LONG RANGE LOCAL STRUCTURE PARAMETERS
	#GENERALLY DOESNT "GO TO ZERO" UNTIL ~ 7-10 ANGSTROMGS
