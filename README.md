# PYFIT-FF
Authors: James Hickman (NIST) and Adam Robinson (GMU) 
Description: 
This code uses pytorch to train a Neural network to reproduce a single component system's potential energy surface for use in classical molecular dynamics simulations by approximating energies obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations



# Input files
The code require two input files 
1) The DFT database file which contains POSCAR files, DFT energies and optionally DFT forces 
2) An input
If ITRAIN_FORCE==TRUE then 


# Output files
 

# Dependence
